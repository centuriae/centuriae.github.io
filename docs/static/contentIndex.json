And what is the potential impact of those ideas when articulated?\nCenturiae is a set of ten weekend writing retreats, each comprising ten people, each producing an essay about the future of British science, technology, &amp; progress.\nWhat emerges is an collated artefact from the deepest thinkers of our time—one hundred essays. Cards on the table, out in the open. Perfect? Certainly not! But now articulated. And then: contemplated, discussed, celebrated, argued over, interrogated, built upon.\nRefined in the fire.

The word “essay” has etymological roots in “to weigh”, and that is a useful description—to assert an idea, and then to measure its weight, its quality, its material properties. Useful for the self, certainly, but even better in public! Indeed, I see such an effort as a form of asynchronous mobilisation towards paradigmatic shifts. A concrete artefact which can then be iterated upon, to guide a grand vision.\nThe great Michael Nielsen denotes this format as the writing of vision papers, citing some incredible examples—written pieces which catalysed immense progress in fields of computing, physics, and biology. I have some contemporary favourites too, such as Sam Rodriques and Adam Marblestone’s proposal of Focused Research Organisations, or even just the opportunity space descriptions from the UK’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency. Big, bold ideas, clearly articulated.\nSo, the important question is: how do we get more of them?\nMy thesis is twofold: brilliant people struggle to find (a) the time and space to overcome the inertia of refining and writing down their ideas, and (b) the public accountability to finish that writing.\nIn the software world, hackathons are massively popular, as a rapid way to experimentally validate an idea. Can we inject this flavour into our rapid iteration of bold ideas? We hear about “builder retreats” in the start-up space often; can we instil that drive into the plotting of ambitious research paths? Can we lean into the joy of community—creating something together, in what Ben James identifies as a key to aliveness? Can we give people the openness to truly sit with—and reflect on—a thought? Perhaps we simply need to escape the city.\nI know that the brilliant people are out there (I meet them, often!), and I am convinced there is a multitude of ideas brewing in each of their minds. We simply need to create the right environment for these ideas to manifest. Hence, I propose a series of focused writing retreats, bringing together deep thinkers from a range of disciplines, to write their ideas down and share them publicly.\nThere are big question marks, of course. One hundred questions is a lot! Will people want to go away with strangers? How do we foster good group dynamics, without it feeling like a boring school camp? Is a weekend enough to articulate and refine an idea? Do people feel comfortable releasing something rough and possibly unfinished—are they open to the critique that may follow?\nI’m not sure! But I think it’s worth a shot."}}
