What emerges will be a collated artefact from deep thinkers: this site, existing in perpetuity, filled with thoughts about the future, about the present, about the past. About what has happened, what may happen, what should happen. Where are we? Where should we go next? By writing these ideas down, we put our cards on the table, out in the open. Perfect?

Still, one hundred essays is a lot! Is there enough to say? Almost certainly, yes, but it will take some time to get there\u2014we'll need to sustain the energy.
